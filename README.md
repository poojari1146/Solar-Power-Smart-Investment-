üåû Delta Warehousing LLC ‚Äì Solar Energy Decision Analysis
A comprehensive decision analysis project to assess the feasibility and impact of solar energy integration for Delta Warehousing LLC in Dearborn, Michigan.

üìò Project Overview
Delta Warehousing LLC, a B2B storage facility, explored the adoption of solar energy as a sustainable alternative to reduce long-term energy costs and carbon emissions. Our team conducted an in-depth decision analysis study covering both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the energy transition.
This repository documents the data-driven journey‚Äîfrom problem framing and modeling to decision-making under uncertainty.

üöÄ Goal
To evaluate whether investing in solar panels is a financially viable and sustainable option for Delta Warehousing LLC, considering cost, energy savings, environmental impact, and risk.

üìå Project Steps
I have followed a structured decision analysis approach broken into the following components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Hierarchy
- We established a clear multi-level objective hierarchy:
- Primary Goal: Minimize energy costs while promoting sustainability.
- Sub-goals: Ensure reliability, maintain business continuity, minimize risk, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Influence Diagram
- We developed an influence diagram to identify all key variables and relationships:
- Decision: Invest in solar panels or not
- Uncertainties: Solar energy production, electricity rates, installation costs
- Outcomes: Annual savings, ROI, emissions avoided

3Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree
- We structured the problem into a decision tree to visualize decision paths and outcomes under uncertainty. It helped us:
- Quantify monetary values
- Assign probabilities to solar efficiency and pricing scenarios
- Identify optimal decision paths

4Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Profile
- We computed the risk profile for each decision alternative (invest vs. not invest):
- Plotted expected monetary values (EMV)
- Highlighted trade-offs between cost savings and uncertainty
- Found that the solar option had higher expected value with moderate risk

5Ô∏è‚É£ Sensitivity Analysis
- We explored how outcomes vary based on changes in key variables:
- Solar panel efficiency
- Installation cost per watt
- Government incentives
- Electricity price escalation<br>
‚Üí This step helped us pinpoint critical variables impacting the decision.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Monte Carlo Simulation
- We ran simulations to model the uncertainty of real-world outcomes:
- Used probability distributions for uncertain inputs
- Simulated thousands of outcomes
- Gained insight into most likely cost savings

7Ô∏è‚É£ Value of Information
- We calculated the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI):
- Assessed whether more research (e.g., site surveys) would significantly improve decision-making
- Concluded EVPI was low, so current data is sufficient for a confident recommendation

‚úÖ Final Recommendation
Based on EMV, risk profile, and simulation outcomes, investing in solar energy is the optimal decision for Delta Warehousing LLC.
Payback period: ~6‚Äì7 years
Long-term savings: Significant over 20 years
Environmental benefit: ~48 tons of CO‚ÇÇ offset annually
